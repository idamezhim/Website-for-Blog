            <p>
                My name is Karen Efe, I have a funny-sounding middle name which we might have trouble pronouncing.
                I enjoy writing, painting, reading,singing, travelling, going to the beach (I have never gone to the beach, but I am certain that I would enjoy it), making videos,dancing with my friends and family (I am an absolutely terrible dancer).
            </p>
            <p>
                A part of me feels like I was born for the Arts, but I found myself drawn to the Sciences(I am currently studying Medicine and Surgery at the University of Port-Hacourt, Nigeria) and I am trying to strike a balance between these two since they individually find a way to pull me closer to them.
            </p>
             <p> 
                I'm also a lover of animals (animals that do not crawl and animals that are not scary - rats and cockroaches do not belong here obviously)
            </p>
            <p> 
                I started writing on a hot sunny day in the month of February 2019 while sitting at the passenger's seat of an autorickshaw, I was staring at a wedding poster and that was what I wrote about.
                I fell in love with writing from them on and I knew that every word,every single letter of the alphabet had a place for me.
